RdioSdkBindings
===============

C# bindings for the Rdio SDKs (Android supported, iOS hopefully soon)

Usage
=====

Just add the Rdio.Android.csproj to your Xamarin.Android project and add a reference to Rdio.Android.

Android
=======
The C# namespaces for the Android SDK are `Rdio.Android.Sdk` and `Rdio.Android.Sdk.Services`. Also note
that the main `Rdio` class has been renamed to `RdioAPI`.


iOS
===

Hopefully, I will be able to find some time to create bindings for the iOS SDK. If there is demand, it'll
happen sooner rather than later :)
